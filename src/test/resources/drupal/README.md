## Introduction

This directory contains resource files used by the JUnit tests.

## Files

"Online Staff Directory Mapping" Google Sheets document, that maps fields from
the various sources (LDAP, "Staff" sheet) to the Drupal fields.

### test_persons.json

A minimal "persons.json" file to use for test, as would be generated by the
"staff-retriever" script.

### expected_drupal_output.json

JSON file generated by the "drupal-builder" script from the "test_persons.json"
file:

```
> target/appassembler/bin/drupal-builder  --config config.properties \
    --input src/test/resources/drupal/test_persons.json \
    --output src/test/resources/drupal/expected_drupal_output.json
