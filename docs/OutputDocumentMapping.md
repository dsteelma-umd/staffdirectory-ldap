# Output Document Mapping

## Introduction

Each output document has a dedicated sheet in the
"Online Staff Directory Mapping" Google Sheets document that describes how the
output should be generated.

For example, the "all-staff-list-builder" script generates the Excel spreadsheet
using the "All Staff Mapping" sheet to describe the columns to include and
how the column values are set and formatted.

Each mapping sheet consists of the following columns:

* Destination Field
* Source
* Source Field
* Display Type

The order of the rows in the mapping document determines the order of the
fields in the output document.

### Destination Field

The name of the field in the output (for example, the name of the column in the
Excel spreadsheet).

### Source

The data source, which can be one of:

* Derived - Data is a "derived" value (see below).
* LDAP - Data is retrieved from LDAP
* Staff - Data is retrieved from the "Staff" sheet of the Google Sheets document

### Source Field

The field in the source the data is retrieved from.

* For "Derived" the content is a human-readable description of how the field
  is generated. The value is not used programmatically.
* For "Staff" the value must match a column header on the "Staff" sheet.
* For "LDAP" the value must match an LDAP attribute.

### Display Type

The "type" of the field for use in formatting for display.

The allowed values are determined by the output document.

The "Text" type (which displays the value unchanged) should always be available.

## Derived Values

Marking the "Source" of a field as "Derived" indicates that it is the
responsibility of the application to generate the value for that field.

The "Source Field" should provide a human-readable description of how the
field is derived, but this value is not used programmatically.

It is suggested that, where possible, a "\<Source>::\<Field> pattern be followed
when writing the description. For example, for the "Descriptive Title" field
in the "All Staff List Mapping" document:

```
Staff::Functional Title if not empty, otherwise LDAP::umDisplayTitle
```

## all-staff-list-builder

The fields in the Excel spreadsheet generated by the "all-staff-list-builder"
script uses the following sheets in the "Online Staff Directory Mapping"
Google Sheets document:

* All Staff List Mapping
* CategoryStatus

The following "Display Type" types are available:

* CategoryStatus - Uses the "CategoryStatus" sheet to expand an abbreviation to
                   its full text
* Percentage - Value is displayed as a numeric percentage
* PhoneNumber - Value is treated as a phone number
* Text - Value is displayed unchanged
